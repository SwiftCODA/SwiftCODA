# 👋 Hey, I’m Jarren

I like building systems that feel smooth, scale properly, and actually get used.  
I’ve spent the last few years working across mobile, web, and backend, always trying to make tech feel fast, reliable, and fun to use.

### 🎮 It Started With GameSense
A few years ago I built **GameSense Tracker**, an iOS stats app for Ubisoft games.  
It grew to over **300,000 users** and handled **30,000 concurrent accounts**, powered by Node.js servers I built and scaled myself.  
That project taught me everything I love about engineering: data pipelines, real-time systems, and building products that people genuinely care about.  
It also made me appreciate how much good design, structure, and persistence matter when something takes off.

### 🧠 What I Work With
**Languages:** TypeScript, Python, C++, Java, Swift, Dart, Go, SQL  
**Frameworks:** Node.js, Express, Nest.js, React, React Native, Next.js, Tailwind, Docker  
**Infra:** AWS (ECS, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda), Redis, Nginx, GitHub Actions  
**Other:** Distributed systems, serverless backends, AI prompt engineering, and naming files slightly better than `final_v3_realfinal.js`

### 🚀 What I’m Building Now
- 🧩 **Aperture AI:** a photo assistant that turns text prompts into Lightroom-style presets  
- ⚙️ Experimenting with distributed systems, AI integrations, and developer tooling  
- 💬 Always finding new ways to make codebases more readable and collaborative

### 🌊 When I’m Not Coding
You’ll usually find me:
- 🏒 Playing hockey  
- 🧗‍♂️ Bouldering (and pretending I’m stronger than I am)  
- 🌅 Hanging at the beach or planning the next road trip  
- 🍺 Trying new craft beers with friends
